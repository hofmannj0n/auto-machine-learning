automated machine learning

This application allows a user to generate stock market data in one of two ways:
1. Generating data inside the application using widgets and drop down menus
2. Generating data by filling out a paper order form, that can be scanned into the OCR algorithim present in the application

The application then provides the user with a data profile, as well as visualizations of all the target columns

In the final step, the user is prompted to "Run Modeling" which triggers the running of all popular machine learning algorithims on the users target columns

The user is then able to download their data with prediction labels, based on the most accurate model by MSE, for further use and experimentation.

Hope you enjoy, please contact me with any questions as I am very passionate about this project and technology! :)
